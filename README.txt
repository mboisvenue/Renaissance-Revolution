Hello there, 
If you are reading this then you are probably an employer I have applied to.
I hope you don't judge the code here too harshly, I KNOW lol. The code is a hot mess
I am designing and adding features on the fly. This will be the first of three verions of this site.

On this version I will use vanilla code, no backend and no framework. So you should just be able to download 
and open the home.html in you browser to view the site.

Thank you for viewing my work!!


SIDENOTE: 
The Next iteration of this site I will add a backend using node.JS/express and mongoDB/mongoose. 

the Final page that I will put on the web will have the front end rewritten in React.(It sorely needs it);
