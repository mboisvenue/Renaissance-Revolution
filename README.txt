Hello there, 
If you are reading this then you are probably an employer I have applied to.
I hope you don't judge the code here too harshly, I KNOW lol. The code is a hot mess
I am designing and adding features on the fly. This will be the first of three verions of this site.

EDIT:
open with live server or else the code breaks

Thank you for viewing my work!!


SIDENOTE: 
The Next iteration of this site I will add a backend using node.JS/express and mongoDB/mongoose. 

the Final page that I will put on the web will have the front end rewritten in React.(It sorely needs it);
