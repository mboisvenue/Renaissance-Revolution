        <h1>What we are about...</h1>
        <p>&emsp; This site is being developed in order to create a community that promotes being or becoming a polymath, autodidact or a renaissance person. In the past several years there has begun a resurgence of dilettantism, which in my opinion is due to our society’s culture of too many choices. There are too many people that end up dabbling in many subjects but never becoming effective in any of them. In the western world we have two contradicting positions about the nature of one’s career. Firstly, it is taught (beginning especially with the millennial generation) that one can pursue and may become anything they put their mind to. But it also is taught that we must specialize in our chosen path, which is why in many cases young people feel trapped going to university because of the perception that they must specialize. </p>
        <br>
        <p>&emsp;This community I am trying to build is one that contends with the status quo and tells the world that mankind was never meant to be specialized. No longer should humans be forced to sit quietly at desks or their workstations, puddering silently away until their boss man tells them when to stop. <br></p>
        <br>
        <p>&emsp;So let us come together and help each other strive towards greatness, push each other forward, help those who struggle and journey forth and achieve great things.</p>
